# Eclipse Xtext Core Framework

This repository contains the platform-independent language framework of Xtext.

## How To Build

Check out and run `./gradlew build`.

The additional command line argument `-PcompileXtend=true` activates the [Xtend](http://xtend-lang.org) compiler, but this is optional because the generated Java code is included in the repository.
